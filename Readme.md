# flutter-clean-architecture-collection

Collection clean architecture of [Flutter Guys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V_P6dovixg), [Flutter Mapp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmJB8cy8emU), [Reso Coder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc3B_mMrZ-Q). **Upgrade all package to lastest and fix code: 09/02/2025 (dd/mm/yyyy)**

## Note

**In Reso Coder I use mocktail insteal mockito**

I want avoid Generate Code when write test, and i can't find way handle Future without generate code.
<br/>
I new at write test in Flutter so test code may not correctly. All test passed.
